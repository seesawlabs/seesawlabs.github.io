        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/labsVR@2x.png" alt="" class="visiblemobile"/>
        <p>The fast, completely free WiFi they provide is funded through its groundbreaking digital OOH advertising network that not only provides a rich context-aware platform, reaching countless New Yorkers and visitors each day, but will also generate more than a half a billion dollars in revenue for New York City.</p>
        <p>Because timing is everything, we've custom build a data gathering and aggregation platform as well as an Austin based QA unit, tied right into the NYC network. These innovative tools allow us to rapidly test and populate the LinkNYC system with the data&#8209driven dynamic ad campaigns crucial to the success to the project.</p>
