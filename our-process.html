        <p>Process is critical to the success of digital development, but it's not a one&#8209size&#8209fits&#8209all exercise. Process often has to be tailored to the type of project and to the needs of the rockstars.</p>
        <p>Part of our partnership promise is finding the right ryhthm when working together. The following provides a general framework that we employ when getting those rockstars ideas realized and launched.</p>
