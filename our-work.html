            <h4>Case Study</h4>
            <h2>LinkNYC KIOSKS</h2>
            <p class="firstParagraph">Seesaw Labs has partnered with CityBridge and Intersection to provide a turnkey solution for implementing the dynamic, data-driven, HTML5 advertisements displayed on over 500 LinkNYC kiosks throughout the five boroughs.</p>
            <p>The fast, completely free WiFi they provide is funded through its groundbreaking digital OOH advertising network that not only provides a rich context-aware platform, reaching countless New Yorkers and visitors each day, but will also generate more than a half a billion dollars in revenue for New York City.</p>
            <p>Because timing is everything, we've custom built a data gathering and aggregation platform as well as an Austin based QA unit, tied right into the NYC network. These innovative tools allow us to rapidly test and populate the LinkNYC system with the data-driven dynamic ad campaigns crucial to the success of the project.</p>
